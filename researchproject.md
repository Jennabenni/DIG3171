# Abstract

<h2>Impacts of Art Therapy on the Wellbeing of the Individual and the Community</h2>

<p>	Traumatic events can often leave people to have clouded emotions that they cannot access directly.  To tap into these emotions, one must clear their mind, but often find it difficult on how to proceed. While there are many techniques that can be used, art therapy, with its broad variation of techniques, has been found to be highly successful in a variety of patients.  The patients vary from children to adults, and varying degrees of traumatic or emotional experiences.  This project focused on helping individuals speak without words in processing their emotions.  The methods varied between cognitive, symbolic, and kinesiology practices with art (Phang) and have examples of group practices and one-on-one sessions with art therapists.  The research not only targeted patients seeking help, but additionally art therapists themselves, communities of people, and the many variations that encompasses ‘art therapy’.  This project used an AI chatbot trained on the different research sources and can help answer questions using specifics discussed in the peer-reviewed journals.  Not every article existed in the same environment.  Designing one's own tattoos can act as a form of self expression that allows a form of communication not involving words (Alter-Muri).  The patients are additionally not required to be ‘artistically-inclined’ either, and simplified techniques that utilize dots and lines have proven to be an excellent tool regardless of simplicity (Steinhardt).  Certain studies additionally show benefits amongst connecting groups of people, such as a community divided (Glinzak, Dunkelberger) or women staying together in prison (Arjona, Van Lith).  The therapy practices themselves and techniques are also a point of discussion, and described that location and personal biases influence how art therapists practice and being aware of these biases can aid in one expanding their mind on different practices (Huang, Kapitan) (Phang).  ‘Art’ is a broad term and encompasses many different activities that can both be done by oneself or in a community.  Therapy utilizing artistic practices has shown benefits and insight to people of all ages and locations and does not ‘fix’ the issue but allows for the individual to process their emotions effectively.  For complex feelings, trauma, expanding one’s mind, or even as an engaging activity, art offers many benefits and should be utilized more frequently in everyday life.  </p>
