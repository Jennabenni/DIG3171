Voyant results:

![Word cloud of speech "You are Brilliant and the Earth is hiring"](voyantFile.jpg)


Analysis:

From the text, I can discern the most repeated words that appear, the main word being ‚Äúpeople‚Äù, which appeared 14 times.  It shows how many words appear per sentence, the sentences that the words appear in, and gives a visual on where the words appear in the text.  However, I can‚Äôt grasp the main points from the speech, the meaning ‚Äì unless I read the ‚Äòreader‚Äô section at the top ‚Äì and I can‚Äôt understand how it was supposed to flow.  The results are accurate, as it gives the evidence of where the words appear.  Additionally, it wasn‚Äôt giving an analysis of the meaning of the text but rather analyzed the patterns inside the text (with evidence) and therefore was accurate for that purpose.

CoPilot response:

üîπ Summary
This speech is a passionate address to a graduating class, urging them to take responsibility for the planet and humanity‚Äôs future. It blends environmental urgency with poetic reflection, historical context, and a call for collective action. The speaker emphasizes interconnectedness, the need for a new societal ‚Äúoperating system,‚Äù and the importance of hope, creativity, and courage in the face of global challenges.

üîπ Key Points & Themes
Environmental Crisis & Urgency

Every living system on Earth is in decline, and the rate is accelerating.
Civilization needs a new operating system, and the graduates are the programmers.
Call to Action

The Earth is ‚Äúhiring‚Äù ‚Äî it needs people to restore and protect it.
Don‚Äôt be discouraged by what seems impossible; act first, assess later.
Hope Through Collective Effort

Despite grim data, optimism is found in the people working to restore the planet.
Millions are engaged in efforts across sectors ‚Äî NGOs, nonprofits, schools, farms, etc.
Historical Inspiration

The abolitionist movement is cited as an example of people organizing for justice without personal gain.
Today‚Äôs global movement for environmental and social justice is even larger.
Interconnectedness of Life

The speech explores biological interconnectedness, emphasizing that life is a miracle.
Our bodies are communities of cells and microorganisms working in harmony.
Spiritual & Philosophical Reflections

References to poets, philosophers, and religious teachings underscore the sacredness of life.
The stars, nature, and everyday miracles are reminders of beauty and purpose.
Empowerment & Responsibility

The graduates are entrusted with the most significant challenge of any generation.
Cynicism is rejected in favor of hope, imagination, and action.

Analysis:

I can discern the key points that the speaker made as well as the different literary and historical references that were made throughout the text.  I know from CoPilot‚Äôs summary that it was addressing a graduating class, telling and urging them to care about the environment and that it has been left in their hands, as previous generations have failed.  I can‚Äôt know the context of the references or what the actual quotes are, nor can I know the flow of the speech or the order that the information is presented in.  The results however were accurate to the speech and gave a thorough summary of the speech.

Reflection:

Using both Voyant and CoPilot offered vastly different results when analyzing the speech ‚ÄúYou are Brilliant and the Earth is Hiring‚Äù by Paul Hawken.  Voyant analyzed the patterns in the text and showed how often certain words reappear, as well as how many words appear per sentence on average.  CoPilot allows for a conversation between you and an AI, and after giving it the text, you can ask for a summary, key points, or specifics on different literary references that the speaker made.  I found CoPilot to be more useful, as I am unsure of the benefit of Voyant ‚Äì I don‚Äôt see a purpose on finding the most reoccurring words in a text.  With Distant reading, I would want to look at summaries over word clouds to get a vague idea of what the writer is trying to say, and investigate it based on the summary, rather than patterns.  Patterns lack in indicating the quality of a text and gives vague information that would be more confusing than a summary.  The tools, however, cannot tell the reader/researcher the context and where the information appears in the text, and how it ties into the overall theme of the text.  These tools should be used to understand the text without reading it but still requires a through read to fully understand.  It‚Äôs like a movie trailer; the trailer gives you enticing information out of context, yet watching the movie helps aid in adding context and makes the scenes more impactful.
