# Distant Reading Assignment 

Voyant results:

![Word cloud of speech "You are Brilliant and the Earth is hiring"](voyantFile.jpg)



From the text, I can discern the most repeated words that appear, the main word being “people”, which appeared 14 times.  It shows how many words appear per sentence, the sentences that the words appear in, and gives a visual on where the words appear in the text.  However, I can’t grasp the main points from the speech, the meaning – unless I read the ‘reader’ section at the top – and I can’t understand how it was supposed to flow.  The results are accurate, as it gives the evidence of where the words appear.  Additionally, it wasn’t giving an analysis of the meaning of the text but rather analyzed the patterns inside the text (with evidence) and therefore was accurate for that purpose.
