  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p>
Art, culture, and community are three topics that are closely intertwined and have an impact on each other.  Pieces can be passed down through generations and garner meaning as the years pass and can help the younger generations understand the old.  “It Takes a Village” is a Bitsy interactive narrative designed to emphasize the importance of community, and follows an artist trying to make a home for themselves.  The player is faced with two choices: stay and build a community, or leave the village and try to find your place somewhere else.  Bitsy uses a 16x16 grid and is structured by ‘rooms’ that allow for different exits or endings depending on the user’s actions.  While the choices in this narrative are limited, each route brushes upon different concepts discussed in the journal: “A Living Art: Thinking with Objects”.  The first ending, where the user stays in the village, emphasizes community and how relationships with others are crucial, whereas the second ending takes a magical turn and discusses different art pieces ‘communicating’ their history; in this case, the objects can actually speak.  While both endings are fairly different, they both contain the topic of art and community, and relies on the player to decide which topic they would like to experience first.
