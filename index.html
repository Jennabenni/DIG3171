<h1>Digital Humanities Portfolio</h1>

<p>My name is Jenna Blubaugh, and I am a senior in Digital Media Web and Social Platforms track at the University of Central Florida.  I am adept in html, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and
using MySQL databases.  I have also worked with wireframes through Figma and have designed layouts for apps and websites, and additionally did user testing for an app design project.  
I have done art since I was a child, and have worked with different mediums such as acrylic, gouache, oil, watercolor, ceramics and clay, wood carving, charcoal, and digital.  I have 
sales experience, as I am currently a leasing agent for a student-living apartment complex.
